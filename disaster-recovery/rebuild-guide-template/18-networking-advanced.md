# Chapter 18 -- Networking Advanced

**Depends on:** [Chapter 03](./03-firewall.md), [Chapter 04](./04-switch.md)

## LACP Tuning

<!-- Hash algorithm, throughput baselines, multi-flow performance -->

---

## QoS / Traffic Shaping

<!-- Bandwidth limits, priority queues, traffic classes -->

---

## VPN Configuration (Detailed)

<!-- WireGuard/OpenVPN peer configs, routing, DNS over VPN -->

---

## DNS High Availability

<!-- Multiple DNS servers, zone replication, failover -->

---

## IPv6

<!-- IPv6 status: disabled, SLAAC, DHCPv6, dual-stack -->

---

## Network Monitoring

<!-- SNMP, syslog, NetFlow/sFlow -->

---

## Troubleshooting Procedures

<!-- Common network issues and diagnostic steps -->

---

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] LACP trunks show expected throughput
- [ ] QoS rules apply correctly
- [ ] VPN tunnel connects from all peers
- [ ] DNS resolves from all VLANs
